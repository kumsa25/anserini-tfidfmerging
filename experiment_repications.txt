build_optimal_expansion.ipynb
    - from a corpus and queries, creates mapping from specific query terms to "optimal" expansion terms selected 
    from the corpus by cosine similairty
    - run startv3

build_all_expansions.ipynb
    - uses config_wordnet.json and config_optimal.json to create expanded_queries_final
    - also pulls optimal from build_optimal_expansion.ipynb output


run_experiments_script.py
    - takes everything in expanded_queries_final and outputs runs_final

scores_to_latex.ipynb
    - runs_final to latex table


Todos:
1. [DONE] sig testing (two score files each query, score)
2. [DONE] change p@30 to p@10
3. simulations
    - keep, explain more, or re-do?
4. run on covid
5. determine which results to report

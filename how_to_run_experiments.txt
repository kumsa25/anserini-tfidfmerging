## To run the experiments
In run_experiments_script.py,
    comment/uncomment lines 3/4 for desired stemming
    comment/uncomment lines 6/10 for desired idf
    comment/uncomment lines 67-81 for desired bm25(s), (non) optimal
        ONLY DO ONE AT A TIME
        ONLY DO bm25 WITH "-originalidf"
    run "python3 run_experiments_script.py"
    run should be saved to runs_final/$stem/$idf/<run_params>.txt
    query scores should be saved to runs_final/$stem/$idf/<run_params>.txt.scores
